# Merge Sort

---

## Aim
Sort an array using Merge Sort (Divide and Conquer).

---

## Algorithm
1. Recursively divide the array into halves until single elements.
2. Merge sorted halves using `merge()`.

---

## Complexity
- Time: O(n log n)
- Space: O(n) additional for merging

---

## Example
Input: arr = [5,2,9,1,5,6]

Sorted: [1,2,5,5,6,9]
