# Selection Sort

---

## Aim
Sort an array using Selection Sort and report the number of steps (comparisons + swaps).

---

## Algorithm
1. Read n and arr[0..n-1].
2. For i = 0 to n-2:
   - Find index of minimum element in arr[i..n-1]
   - Swap arr[i] with arr[minIndex] if needed
3. Array sorted.

## Complexity
- Worst / Average / Best: O(n^2)
